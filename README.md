# mimsa-runtimes

One plan to handle side effects in Mimsa is not to!

Ie, copy the Elm idea where you give your `Mimsa` code to a JS function, which does stuff with it, using it as a DSL type thing.

There are some experiments with such runtimes, by which I really mean "here is some hacky as fuck javascript that I am ashamed of"
